Sefarad allow advanced users to craft queries for different endpoints, execute them and download or visualize their data in various ways.

In section _"Add Query"_, users will find a query creator interface. If you are an advanced user and want to create a query with parameters tick the advance selector and follow these steps:

1. Give a name to the query. In the name you have to define which nouns are params. For this purpose, every element that could implement different values must be in bracketts: "\<param>".
**Name example:** _"Nobel laureates in \<fieldOfScience> ordered by \<order> of birth date"_ where _fieldOfScience_ and _order_ will be params.

2. For each defined parameter, enter their possible values below.

3. Write an URL endoint.

4. Write the query text.

5. Save the query.

Now you will be able to execute the query in the _"SPARQL editor"_ tab and see its results.
